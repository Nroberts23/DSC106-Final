# San Diego Water Safety

This is a short visualization project concerning the dangers posed by enterococcus bacteria in the public waters of San Diego.  This project uses data and charts to tell a story and encourage the viewer to take action.

The visualization is hosted on the index.html file, while some EDA is performed in the jupyter notebook.
